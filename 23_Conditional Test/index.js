///Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:
//let car = 'subaru';
//console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
//console.log(car == 'subaru')
// Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.
// Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.
//I create this project on Friday {19/4/2024},So assume this Today....
//Test # 1
var today = "Friday";
console.log("Today is Friday.");
console.log(today == 'Friday');
//Test # 2
console.log("Today is Saturday.");
console.log(today == 'Saturday');
//Test # 3
var date = "19/4/2024";
console.log("Date ? 19/4/2024 ");
console.log(date == "19/4/2024");
//Test # 4
console.log("Date ? 20/4/2024");
console.log(date == '20/4/2024');
//Test # 5
console.log("Friday length == 6");
console.log(today.length == 6);
//Test # 6
console.log("Friday length == 11");
console.log(today.length == 11);
//Test # 7
var addition = 2 + 8;
console.log("2 + 8 == 10 ");
console.log(addition == 10);
//Test # 8
console.log("2 + 8 == 12");
console.log(addition != 10);
//Test # 9
var sign = 5 < 7;
console.log("5 is not less than 7");
console.log(sign != 5 < 7);
//Test # 10
console.log("5 is greater than 7");
console.log(sign == 5 > 7);
